# Data Pipe project

## Objective of the project:
The goal of this project is to apply the data gathering techniques learned at class to analise the relationship betwwen the price of gold with the quantity of money from 198o onwards.

## Sources of the data:
- Gold/USD (XAUUSD) price data is extracted from Koyfin in CSV format.
- M1 and M2 Monetary aggregates are extracted from the Fed's api in Json format.  
 

## Main conclusion :

- Gold has been rising dramatically (7X), and in an ascending pattern (making higher highs and higher lows) a since the year 2000.

- M1 and M2 have grown at a much faster peace than gold since 1980, suggesting that gold hasn't been able to protect the wealth of the investors( Understanding wealth as a % of the total money and not in the nominal quantity of it)

- Acceleration fases in the rise of the price of gold and the quantity of money have happened simultaneously since 1980. 

- Several factors may have provoqued the underperformance of gold vis a vis the quantity of money since the 80's:

    - The privileges of the USD as the world reserve currency and the necessity of international actors to have dollars to transact on regulated markets, creating an artificial demand for the currency
    - The consolidation fase from 1980 to 1990 foillowing the gold bull market from the seventies.
    - A large sum of the money creation being derived from credit, making negative carry assets less atractive due to the necessity of generating cash flows to repay debt. 
    
- The secular chart on XAUM looks on a reversal of the secular trend making a double bottom on a higher low. This would suggest that gold is going to outperform M1 expansion during the following decades.
